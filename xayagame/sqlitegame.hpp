/**
 * Subclass for GameLogic for games that store their state internally
 * in an SQLite database.  They only need to implement the game logic
 * in a single function, namely updating an SQLite database handle for
 * a given block of moves.  Rollbacks and undo data are handled by the
 * SQLiteGame, using the SQLite session extension internally.
 *
 * To ensure consistency and atomic operation between the game's internal
 * data in the database and libxayagame's state, the underlying SQLiteStorage
 * used by SQLiteGame should be used as the main storage in Game (so that it
 * also holds undo data and the current game state).
 *
 * With this GameLogic implementation, the "game state" as seen by libxayagame
 * is simply the keyword string "initial" for the initial state and
 * "block <hash>" with the associated block hash for other states.
 * (The hash is used to counter-check for consistency and make sure that only
 * the current state is ever updated as it is guaranteed by GameLogic.)
 *
 * The undo data for a block is the changeset created by the SQLite session
 * extension for the modifications to the database done by the game itself
 * (but not through the SQLiteStorage, as that is handled by libxayagame).
 *
 * Note that the SQLite session extension has some weird behaviour together
 * with UNIQUE constraints.  Games need to be careful when using those; it
 * will work for most cases, but some edge cases might fail to undo properly.
 * For more information, see the discussion on the sqlite-user mailing list:
 * http://sqlite.1065341.n5.nabble.com/Inverted-changesets-and-UNIQUE-constraints-td108318.html.
