"""
A JSON-RPC server that can be used as broadcasting system, in conjunction
with the RpcBroadcast client implementation.  Messages can be published
by calling RPC methods on the server, and also retrieved by long-polling
RPC calls.

Messages for each channel ID have sequence numbers (assigned by the server).
When a new participant joins the channel, they can request the current number.
Then, when requesting messages, client can specify the sequence number
starting from which they want to retrieve new messages.

Note that while this server is fully functional and can be used for
real game play, it is not optimised for production use yet (e.g. with
proper logging or DoS protection).  For instance, it does not attempt
to ever remove data of previously opened channels.  If we assume that active
clients will poll the server repeatedly, we can implement cleaning up of
old data (messages in an active channel as well as inactive channels) by
simply removing everything that has not been touched in a while.
